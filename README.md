## The Project

Currently in engineering school, I'm trying to learn by myself how NN works and how libraries like Pytorch or Keras are working.

That's why I'm trying to implement a NN C# library from scratch, just for educational purposes.

### Using ...

VSCode

.NET 5.0

## Getting started

In order to get a local copy, follow these steps

### Prerequisites

- Dotnet â©¾ 5.0

and/or

- Visual Studio 2019

### Installation

1. Clone the repository :

```sh
git clone https://github.com/andreamiele/NNNET.git
cd NNNET
```

2. Open the solution NNNET.csproj with VS or VSCode with .NET core and solution explorer extensions.

## How to use it
